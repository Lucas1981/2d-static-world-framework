# Grid demo

So, this is a demo to see how you can build a game engine with JavaScript for the browser, making use of a grid map. To make the game and manage the resources with, I've used my world maker, which can be found on:

https://github.com/Lucas1981/world-maker

Export the file you make with the editor, turn it into a TypeScript `.ts` file (also adding `export default` to the beginning of the file - still have to get the json import to work) and you can use your frames, animations, tiles, actors, maps and sounds directly. The `/demo` file can give you an idea of how to set up all the `./lib` files so that you can manage the game flow and the behaviour of objects in a game stage.

To do:
- Data files should really be json files, now those are .ts because I can't figure out how to feed .json files to TypeScript
- Sometimes you can't move left or right when starting on a position where you should be able to?
