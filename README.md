# Grid demo

So, this is a demo to see how you can build a game engine with JavaScript for the browser, making use of a grid map.

To do:
- Data files should really be json files, now those are .ts because I can't figure out how to feed .json files to TypeScript
- Limit max movement to grid size
- Add sound
- Sometimes you can't move left or right when starting on a position where you should be able to?
